	<p>The project demonstrates successful knowledge transfer, innovation, achieved the project objectives, leveraged industry best practices and results in the substantial adoption and utilization of their health-IT solution. </p>
	<p>Executing any project on time within budget, while hitting all project objectives, is challenging in today's complex, fast-paced realm of enterprise technology.  Add multiple stakeholders and multiple vendors to the partnership and the bar raises even higher.  But the Saskatchewan Client Registry/Initiate Systems team still cleared all the hurdles with poise and professionalism, overcoming complications of scope and scale to implement successfully a Client Registry for Saskatchewan in six months - with senior executive approvals from 15 different stakeholder organizations, including Canada Health Infoway and the provincial government. </p>
	<p>Key deliverables and associated timelines were defined early in the process by vendors and stakeholders alike.  As the project advanced, there was no ambiguity regarding who was responsible for what and when. Saskatchewan demonstrated an unmistakable commitment to vision and partnership, which fostered innovation and creativity on the team.  </p>
	<p>Duplicate medical records were considered to be a patient safety issue as the province supported rural-urban referral patterns. Project funded data cleansing efforts by the sources, including key data elements, like the Personal Health Number, were targeted for corrective action because these play a crucial role in the on-going linking of data. Since deploying software which enables each source stakeholder to monitor and correct their internal source errors, data quality across all sources is down to a national best practice standard of 0.13% from as high as a 10% error range.  This is excellent considering the multi-stakeholder involvement and continuing commitment to the realization that data quality has a 1-1 relationship to patient safety.  </p>
	<p>In summary, what makes the results of the Saskatchewan Client Registry/Initiate Systems team extraordinary is the uncommon collaboration between so many different stakeholder organizations, while exceeding the original scope of work within the outlined timeframes.  </p>

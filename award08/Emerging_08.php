	<p>In order to be considered for this award, the nominee must have demonstrated leadership and achieved breakthrough results in health informatics, been active in promoting and developing the field through participation in industry associations, volunteer boards, publications, conference presentations, or academic organizations and also be recognized by managers and peers for demonstrating innovation, leadership and a significant contribution to the field. The winner of this Award receives a $3000.00 cash contribution to be used for professional development purposes. </p>
	
	<p>The commitment and innovative work of this year's winner, Dr. Chris O'Connor, has significantly contributed to Health Informatics.  He is an advocate and champion for moving the health informatics agenda forward.</p>
	<p>He helped to develop a new wireless protocol to enable the use of cellular communication devices in the hospital by staff and patients - and then led his organizations' ICU team in pioneering a revolution in their busy ICU through a corporate partnership to implement the first use of wireless email in a clinical setting.  This innovative, patient-centred initiative has resulted in faster delivery of medical care, reliable, legible records reducing the chance of error, less intrusive and improved team communication and better team morale.  </p>
	<p>As a critical care physician and acting as the thought leader and project steward for the Order Set Transformation project, Dr. Chris O'Connor has lead his team in developing innovative approaches to the order set lifecycle and order set design. The innovations in order set methodology have resulted in very high rates of order set use and significant improvements in quality of care. In 2006, he founded Open Source Order Sets, a collaborative network of over 50 Canadian hospitals working together to effectively use evidence-based order sets.  He chairs the Physicians User Group and in this capacity is responsible for engaging physicians in the Transforming Health Care into Integrated Networks of Knowledge or "THINK" project with a focus on his organization's electronic medical record project to include computerized physician order entry. </p>
	<p>With experience in Emergency, Critical Care and Internal Medicine, and equipped with formal studies in Biomedical Informatics, he has been an advocate and a champion for moving the health informatics agenda ahead, not only in his own organization, but in Canada. </p>

	<p>Applicants must be of sound academic standing and must demonstrate their involvement and achievement in health informatics. The Scholarship includes a cash honorarium, complimentary COACH membership and e-Health conference registration.</p>
	<p>As a clinician, Dr. Samina Abidi witnessed first-hand the information and knowledge gaps inherent within most healthcare systems, and the ensuing practice related challenges faced by health professionals. She believes that the correct and scientific application of health informatics can bridge the knowledge gap in improving patient's care, flow and safety, and health professionals can be supported by the deployment of point-of-care decision support, care planning and risk assessment tools.   </p>
	<p>Throughout her academic and professional career, she has consistently aimed to gain the right expertise to effect positive changes in the delivery of healthcare. Dr. Abidi's first exposure to health informatics goes back to 1998 in Malaysia when she became involved as a medical doctor in the conception and design of the Malaysian Tele-Healthcare project. This experience made her realize the potential of information technology to influence changes in healthcare delivery. </p>
	<p>She completed a Masters program in Information Technology in 2001, and got involved in research projects concerning the personalization of patient educational material and use of past cases for clinical decision support. In her PhD research, she is pursuing the rather complex issue of developing patient-specific care plans for standardizing patient care and ensuring patient safety-the decision support framework will assist physicians in making correct therapeutic choices when dealing with patient co-morbidities. </p>
	<p>Dr. Abidi's other research achievements include the development of a clinical decision support system for breast-cancer follow-up in collaboration with Cancer Care Nova Scotia, by computerizing the Canadian guideline on breast cancer follow-up and incorporating it as a decision support tool for family physicians performing breast cancer follow-up at their clinics. The research was very innovative and has led to three publications at top health informatics conferences.   She has also developed two undergraduate health informatics courses and hopes that through her research and teaching activities, she will be able to contribute to the advancement of Health Informatics and in turn help to improve healthcare.  Based on her achievements over the last 10 years, we believe we will hear much more from her in the future.</p>

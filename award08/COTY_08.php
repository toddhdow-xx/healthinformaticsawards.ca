	<p>This year's winner, Accenture, exceeded expectations, was committed to achieving successful results, met the toughest challenges head-on and successfully delivered what was proposed with demonstrated innovation.</p>
	<p>The Ontario Ministry of Health's mandate was to improve patient's access to care by reducing surgical wait-times and enabling evidence-based decisions to track and report wait times in five identified key service areas - cancer, cardiac, cataract, hip/knee replacements and MRI/CTs.  Accenture demonstrated responsiveness to the Organization's need from the start of the project and cooperated to find solutions using demand management. Accenture also embraced the "one-team" philosophy. This approach was a key contributor to the team's success in meeting the aggressive deadlines as a cohesive group. </p>
	<p>User adoption was another key success factor enabling successful implementation of the system. Accenture devised a change management strategy, which focused on obtaining buy-in of key stakeholders.  </p>
	<p>Overall, Accenture was able to deploy a culture of transparent information sharing and based on this, was able to successfully address and resolve over 200 issues throughout the project to ensure the system was deployed on time and within budget against very aggressive timelines.  Accenture demonstrated their ability to recognize issue patterns and quickly allocate the appropriate resources to focus on resolving each issue based on a deep understanding of the project requirements and dynamics. </p>
	<p>Expertise in the subject matter, understanding clients' needs, multi-skilled variety of experience and background that could be leveraged were all key factors displayed by our winner.  Accenture delivers innovative, thorough and integrated solutions. They understand how to link and integrate disparate systems and share information to support the clinical and business needs of the involved entities. Accenture has extensive experience building and running large-scale, complex health care IT and clinical systems that incorporate leading-edge technologies and tools as well as addressing the critical strategic, business process and change management issues that accompany such initiatives.

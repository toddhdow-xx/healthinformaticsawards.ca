	<p>Jean Huot is recognized as one of the leading CIOs and health care executives, not only in his province, but in the country.  He is a visionary in the field of healthcare informatics and is respected by his peers for his solid leadership, his credibility and his discipline of 'getting things done.'  He has 25 years of experience in strategic and operational management and consulting in complex environments.  His career in the healthcare sector began in 1992, where he created a health directorate for his employer, dedicated to Health information systems and information technology and positioned CGI as a key IT service provider in both his province and Canada.  In 1998, he was appointed CIO of Montreal University Health Centre and a year later, he became Executive Director of Syscor, supervising operations of a data centre and service provider for all 140 health and social services organizations within the region. In 2002, he was also appointed Director of Technologies for a second health centre - a 'first' among previously competing major teaching hospitals while maintaining his responsibilities with the data centre.</p>
	<p>From that point on, Mr. Huot has had an uncanny ability to fulfill his roles and responsibilities. He is currently leading, with an estimated $200 M budget, the modernization of the information technology infrastructure of the largest university hospitals in his province, within the context of their construction of new ultra-modern installations.  Despite the different management styles of both organizations, he has demonstrated the effectiveness of his guidance across a variety of audiences and received broad acceptance of his vision for integrated clinical information applications and tools empowering care providers and benefiting a community of over 3 million.</p>
	<p>The concept of a unified CIS handling most of the electronic health record has been recently adopted by the Montreal Health Agency for its replication within several major Montreal hospitals.  This decision supports our selection of this individual as this year's winner of the Leadership in the Field of Health Informatics Award, recognizing his vision and dedication, not only to healthcare informatics, but to the community of care providers and patients alike.</p>

	<p>The Nova Scotia Department of Health implemented a province-wide Picture Archiving and Communications System using our recipient's solution. Today, 41 health care sites across the province of Nova Scotia are active with this system which has replaced nearly all film-based medical imaging with faster, safer and more streamlined processes.</p>

	<p>The digital imaging technology implemented in Nova Scotia has been replicated in Sherbrooke & Laval, Quebec and in Alberta. The technology is also being leveraged by Hospital Diagnostic Imaging Repository Services, formerly the Toronto East General Hospital network - an alliance of 23 hospital corporations.</p> -->

	<p>Criteria for consideration for the Award outlined that the innovative approach be for a program or project that has been successfully implemented, that it may not necessarily be national in scope, but can be seen as having a significant impact in a region, province or territory in Canada and that it has the ability to be replicated in other parts of the health care system. In addition, the program or project should demonstrate leading edge thinking and implementation in the subject area of the initiative and a positive impact on health care delivery or outcomes. </p>
	<p>Ventilator Associated Pneumonia is considered to be one of the more serious life threatening ICU complications, despite it being entirely preventable. The Ventilator Associated Pneumonia Surveillance System, developed in the Department of Critical Care Medicine at the Calgary Health Region, demonstrates an innovative example of using health informatics for the purpose of quality improvement and patient safety.</p>
	<p>The project was completed in one year and integrates data from several hospital and departmental systems to produce key information used in the evaluation of suspected cases of VAP.  Infection control practitioners have access to patient demographics, vital physiologic data, radiology and microbiology reports and case specific antibiotic utilization to study every case.  Such data also enables the Department to assess the incidence of this calculation by site, time of year and by case mix.  These findings drive improvement processes, and have resulted in a 75% decrease in incidence over 2 years that if sustained, could potentially translate to a $1.7 million savings annually and ensure continued active participation of all stakeholders.</p>
	<p>This truly significant achievement is the reason that the VAP Surveillance System project was recognized as this year's winner of the Innovation in the Adoption of Health Informatics Award.  Accepting on behalf of his team, from the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Calgary Health Region, the Critical Care Clinical Information System Manager - Reza Shahpori.  </p>

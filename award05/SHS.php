	<p>These experiences have led Elizabeth to pursue doctoral work involving the use of health information systems in the clinical context.  Currently enrolled and receiving exemplary grades as a doctoral candidate and student at the University of Toronto, her thesis research seeks to shed light upon the effects of the electronic patient record upon health professional information seeking.  In the future, she plans to continue these research efforts and to educate future health informaticians and clinicians in the interdisciplinary field of health informatics.  </p>
